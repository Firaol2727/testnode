# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  testnode:
    build:
      context: "."
      dockerfile: "./Dockerfile"
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: development
    ports:
      - 2007:2007
    # networks:
    #   host:
    #     external:true
    #     name:host
    # volumes:
    #   - test_node_volume:uploads
    # container_name: testnode

# The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
# database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
# start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
# database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
# to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
# a password of your choosing to it before running `docker-compose up`.
#     depends_on:
#       db:
#         condition: service_healthy
#   db:
#     image: mysql
#     restart: always
#     volumes:
#       - db-data:/var/lib/mysql
#     environment:
#       - MYSQL_DB=testnode
#       - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
#     expose:
#       - 3306
#     healthcheck:
#       test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
#       interval: 10s
#       timeout: 5s
#       retries: 5
